## About

Lerna is a web application I'm building to help students learn programming more effectively. The idea came from my own experience struggling with coding tutorials that either moved too fast or too slow. I wanted to create something that adapts to how each person learns.

The platform combines an AI tutor for answering questions, practice quizzes that adjust to your skill level, and a gamification system to keep learning engaging. I'm building it with modern tools like Next.js and integrating OpenAI's API for the conversational tutoring feature.

This is both a learning experience for me and hopefully something useful for other students trying to pick up programming.

## What It Does

- Chat with an AI tutor that explains programming concepts in plain language
- Take quizzes that get harder or easier based on how you're doing
- Track your progress and see which topics you're strong in
- Earn points and maintain learning streaks (because why not make it fun)
- Support for multiple languages: Python, JavaScript, Java, and more

## Current Status

This is a work in progress. I'm actively developing the core features and documenting the process along the way. The goal is to have a functional MVP by early January 2026.
